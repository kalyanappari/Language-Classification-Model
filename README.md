# Language-Classification-Model
A Language Classification Chat Bot using the Machine Learning Models. 
This project involves the development of a chatbot that classifies Indian languages using machine learning models. The system leverages character-level n-grams for feature extraction and employs a Naive Bayes classifier, achieving 100% accuracy on a custom dataset. The chatbot is implemented with a user-friendly web interface, enabling real-time language identification and interaction.
